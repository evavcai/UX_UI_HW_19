                    <h2>Hello! My name is Eva.</h2>
                    <p>I’m a UX designer based in Austin, TX. As an undergraduate at Rice University majoring in cognitive science and psychology, I was taught to extract qualitative insights from large amounts of quantitative data to understand human cognition. I want to utilize my knowledge of human thought processes to identify individual pain points and develop solutions that can change people’s lives.</p>
                    <p>After interning for a decentralized finance startup company in 2021, I realized that the world’s future financial system lies in blockchain technologies. My number one priority for designing on a system that many are skeptical about is to convey a sense of trust. Through using a user-centered design approach, my goal is to generate solutions that empower users to feel confident about their financial decisions.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe research and design can bridge the gap between everyday users and seemingly complex blockchain technologies.</p>

                    <h4>User Research</h4>
                    <div class = 'line'></div>
                    <p>User research is the most important step in the design process. I always begin a project with thorough interviews and data collection in order to identify the problem that needs solving. </p>

                    <div class = 'line'></div>
                    <p>Once a solution is made, I begin to sketch, wireframe, and prototype the interface. The tools I use are Figma, Adobe, InVision, and Visual Studio Code. </p>

                    <p>Iteration of the design only improves the outcome. I believe conducting in-depth usability tests is required to complete a project. </p>
